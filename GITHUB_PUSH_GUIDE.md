# Step-by-Step Guide: Pushing to GitHub

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: Open https://github.com in your browser
2. **Sign in** to your GitHub account (or create one if you don't have it)
3. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
4. **Select "New repository"**
5. **Fill in the details**:
   - Repository name: `sales-email-assistant` (or any name you prefer)
   - Description: "AI-powered email assistant for sales team"
   - Choose **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
   - **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have files)
   - **DO NOT** add .gitignore or license (we already have them)
6. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Copy Your Repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions.

You'll see a URL that looks like one of these:
- HTTPS: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sales-email-assistant.git`
- SSH: `git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/sales-email-assistant.git`

**Copy the HTTPS URL** (it's easier for beginners)

## Step 3: Update Your Remote URL

You'll need to update the remote URL to point to your actual GitHub repository.
